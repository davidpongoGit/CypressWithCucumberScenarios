# CypressWithCucumberScenarios

Summary:
I've used Cypress test automation tool at v9.7.0 and created Page-Object Modelling library for the test website. I have also installed and configured various open-source plugins including Cucumber Pre-procesor to write my test cases with BDD/Agile oriented approach.  This demo acts as a showcase of my current automation skills and knowledge of automation architecture. 

Version of Cypress: 
I am using an older version of Cypress because the developers of Cucumber plugin did not updated the plugin to be compatible with the latest generation of Cypress at the time of me installing the plugin.
